    <h2>Professional Self Assessment</h2>
    <p>
Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on how much I have grown both technically and professionally. When I began the program, my primary focus was learning how to write code that worked correctly. As I progressed through my coursework, I began to understand that professional software development involves much more than functionality. It requires thoughtful design, performance awareness, security considerations, structured communication, and the ability to evaluate trade offs. This capstone allowed me to revisit earlier work, enhance it, and present it in a way that clearly demonstrates that growth.
Throughout the program, I developed a strong foundation in software design, algorithms, and database systems. Early courses introduced me to object oriented programming and basic data handling. As I advanced into courses such as CS 300, CS 340, and Secure Coding, I began focusing more on performance, structure, and system level thinking. The artifacts included in this portfolio show how one course planning application evolved across three technical areas. I improved the structure and modularity of the original design, enhanced its efficiency using a Binary Search Tree, and ultimately transformed it into a database backed system using SQLite for persistent storage.
Although much of my work in this program was completed individually, I strengthened my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly through written documentation, recorded code reviews, and structured narratives. Developing the code review video required me to explain how my system worked, identify areas for improvement, and justify design decisions in a clear and organized manner. Writing the artifact narratives required me to reflect on the reasoning behind each enhancement rather than simply describing what the code does. These experiences helped me improve my professional written and oral communication skills, which are essential in the field of computer science.
My understanding of algorithms and data structures grew significantly over time. Initially, I relied on built in containers and basic sorting methods to organize data. As I progressed, I learned how to analyze time complexity and evaluate different data structures based on performance needs. Implementing a Binary Search Tree in the course planner allowed me to demonstrate recursive logic, structured insertion and search operations, and in order traversal to produce sorted output. This enhancement strengthened my understanding of how data structure selection directly affects efficiency and scalability.
Software engineering principles also became central to how I approach development. I learned that well organized, modular, and maintainable code is critical in professional environments. In my software design enhancement, I refactored the original application to improve separation of concerns, input validation, and overall structure. I removed unsafe termination calls, improved user input handling, and selected more appropriate containers for data storage. These improvements reflect a shift from writing code that simply functions to designing systems that are structured and maintainable.
The database enhancement further expanded my understanding of application architecture. By integrating SQLite into the course planner, I transitioned from in memory data storage to a relational database model. I designed tables for courses and prerequisites, implemented primary and foreign key relationships, and used SQL queries to retrieve ordered results. This experience reinforced the importance of normalization, structured querying, and persistent data management. It also helped me understand how applications interact with database systems in real world scenarios.
Security awareness became increasingly important throughout the program. I learned to think about potential vulnerabilities early in the design process rather than as an afterthought. In the database enhancement, I implemented parameterized queries to reduce the risk of SQL injection and enforced foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity. Across all artifacts, I incorporated input normalization and validation to improve reliability and prevent unintended behavior. Developing this mindset has helped me recognize that secure and reliable systems are a fundamental expectation in professional software development.
Together, the artifacts in this portfolio demonstrate growth across software design, algorithms, and databases. Each enhancement builds on the previous version of the application, showing how my technical understanding deepened over time. The software design enhancement focuses on structure and maintainability. The algorithms enhancement demonstrates computational reasoning and performance awareness. The database enhancement reflects persistent storage, relational modeling, and secure data handling. Combined, they show my ability to design, evaluate, and improve computing solutions in a thoughtful and structured way.
Completing this capstone has strengthened my confidence in my technical skills and reinforced the importance of careful design, efficiency, and security in software development. This ePortfolio represents not only the projects I completed during the program but also the growth in my problem solving approach and professional mindset. I feel prepared to continue developing scalable, efficient, and secure systems as I move forward in the computer science field.

    <h2>Artifact 1 – Software Design and Engineering</h2>
    <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my growth in software design and application structure. The original course planning application functioned correctly but relied on basic organization and limited error handling. In this enhancement, I refactored the program to improve separation of concerns, input validation, and overall maintainability. I replaced linear storage with a more scalable container, removed unsafe termination calls, normalized user input, and improved the modular structure of the code. These improvements reflect my ability to design structured, maintainable, and professionally organized software systems rather than simply writing code that works.

<section id="artifact2">
    <h2>Artifact 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>
        This artifact highlights my understanding of algorithmic principles and data structure selection. I enhanced the original course planner by implementing a Binary Search Tree to manage course data. The BST supports recursive insertion, efficient searching, and in order traversal for naturally sorted output. This change improved average search performance and demonstrated my ability to analyze time complexity and performance trade offs. Through this enhancement, I showed that I can apply foundational computer science concepts to improve efficiency and scalability in real applications.

    <h2>Artifact 3 – Databases</h2>
    <p>
        This artifact demonstrates my ability to integrate relational database design into an application. I transformed the original in memory course planner into a database backed system using SQLite. I designed relational tables for courses and prerequisites, implemented primary and foreign key relationships, and used SQL queries to retrieve ordered and filtered data. I also incorporated parameterized queries to improve security and data integrity. This enhancement reflects my understanding of persistent storage, normalization, structured querying, and secure database interaction in professional software development.
